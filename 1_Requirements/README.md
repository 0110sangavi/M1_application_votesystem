 1.	Introduction-
The Test Plan outlines the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of all testing activities. It identifies the items and features to be tested; types of testing. Online e-voting system needs to be tested with all the features. It lists the tests for Version 1.0.  

   2. Research-
   The framework used of structuring, planning and controlling the process in developing information system in software engineering is known as Software development methodology or System development methodology. (www.itinfo.am, 2014) [14]. The events completed at each step of a software development project is describes by a framework Software development life cycle (SLDC). (slideshare.net, 2014) [15]. 

  3. Cost, Features and Timelines-
  A.Costs-
  Our methodology can be broken down as follows:
  1.Narrowing the electoral cycle.
  2.Conducting process mapping, business process modelling and data collection.
  3.Creating a list of activities and identifying resource pools.
  4.Attributing costs to activities and adopting confidence measures: practical capacities and confidence intervals.
  5.Transferring costs per activity to cost per ballot.
  
  B. Features-
  1.Fast and easy way of conducting Election.
  2.Voters can view background of each Candidate.
  3.Candidate can present themselves against voters.
  4.Admin can verify the documents and details of Candidate.
  5.System Generated Unique ID and Password gives more Secure Logins.
  6. Within Few Hours Results are generated.
  
  C. Timeline-
 i. Client
 Client is any user or program that wants to perform an operation over the system.Clients interact with the system through a presentation layer.
 ii. Presentation Layer
 This layer is responsible for the presentation of data at the client side, i.e., it provides an
interface for the end-user into the application.
 iii. Resource manager
The resource manager deals with the organization (storage, indexing and retrieval) ofthe data necessary to 
support the application logic. This resource manager is typically a database.
 iv. Application logic
The application logic figures out what the system actually does. It takes care implementing the business rules 
and establishing the business processes.UoM online voting system is designed and implemented according to 
the three tier architecture.

4. Defining Our System-
   Electronic voting (also known as e-voting) is voting that uses electronic means to either aid or take care of casting and counting votes.
   Depending on the particular implementation, e-voting may use standalone electronic voting machines (also called EVM) or computers connected to the Internet. It may encompass a range of Internet services, from basic transmission of tabulated results to full-function online voting through common connectable household devices. The degree of automation may be limited to marking a paper ballot, or may be a comprehensive system of vote input, vote recording, data encryption and transmission to servers, and consolidation and tabulation of election results.
  In general, two main types of e-voting can be identified:-
  e-voting which is physically supervised by representatives of governmental or independent electoral authorities (e.g. electronic voting machines located at polling stations);
  remote e-voting via the Internet (also called i-voting) where the voter submits his or her vote electronically to the election authorities, from any location.

Requirements

Introduction-
An online voting system is a software platform that allows groups to securely conduct votes and elections. High-quality online voting systems balance ballot security, accessibility, and the overall requirements of an organization's voting event.
At their core, online voting systems protect the integrity of your vote by preventing voters from being able to vote multiple times. As a digital platform, they eliminate the need to gather in-person, cast votes using paper, or by any other means (e.g. email, insecure survey software). 
You may hear an online voting system being referred to as an online election system, an online e voting system, or electronic voting. These all make reference to the same thing: a secure voting tool that allows your group to collect input from your group and closely scrutinize the results in real time.

Research-
The framework used of structuring, planning and controlling the process in developing information system in software engineering is known as Software development methodology or System development methodology. (www.itinfo.am, 2014) [14]. The events completed at each step of a software development project is describes by a framework Software development life cycle (SLDC). (slideshare.net, 2014) [15].

Cost, Features and Timelines-
A.Costs-
Our methodology can be broken down as follows:
1.Narrowing the electoral cycle.
2.Conducting process mapping, business process modelling and data collection.
3.Creating a list of activities and identifying resource pools.
4.Attributing costs to activities and adopting confidence measures: practical capacities and confidence intervals.
5.Transferring costs per activity to cost per ballot.

B. Features-
1.Fast and easy way of conducting Election.
2.Voters can view background of each Candidate.
3.Candidate can present themselves against voters.
4.Admin can verify the documents and details of Candidate.
5.System Generated Unique ID and Password gives more Secure Logins.
6.Within Few Hours Results are generated.

C. Timeline-
i. Client
Client is any user or program that wants to perform an operation over the system.Clientsinteract with the system through a presentation layer.
ii. Presentation Layer
This layer is responsible for the presentation of data at the client side, i.e., it provides an
interface for the end-user into the application.
iii. Resource manager
The resource manager deals with the organization (storage, indexing and retrieval) ofthe data necessary to
support the application logic. This resource manager is typically a database.
iv. Application logic
The application logic figures out what the system actually does. It takes care implementing the business rules
and establishing the business processes.UoM online voting system is designed and implemented according to
the three tier architecture.

Defining Our System-
Electronic voting (also known as e-voting) is voting that uses electronic means to either aid or take care of casting and counting votes.
Depending on the particular implementation, e-voting may use standalone electronic voting machines (also called EVM) or computers connected to the Internet. It may encompass a range of Internet services, from basic transmission of tabulated results to full-function online voting through common connectable household devices. The degree of automation may be limited to marking a paper ballot, or may be a comprehensive system of vote input, vote recording, data encryption and transmission to servers, and consolidation and tabulation of election results.
In general, two main types of e-voting can be identified:-
e-voting which is physically supervised by representatives of governmental or independent electoral authorities (e.g. electronic voting machines located at polling stations);
remote e-voting via the Internet (also called i-voting) where the voter submits his or her vote electronically to the election authorities, from any location.

SWOT Analysis- STRENGTH OF ONLINE VOTING:-
1.Reduce cost of voting  
2. Voting in any language convenient to the voter 
3. Tackling social, technical, political, legal and economic issues associated with elections. 
4. Serves as enabler and a convenient way in involving citizens in political decision. 
5. Mobile voting is cheaper to implement in voting 
6. It simplifies and eases access to the integration of persons and institutions in political process.
7. Input to political decision-making can be improved with mobile voting, thereby increasing their democratic participation.  
8. Electronic voting eliminates queue during voters’ registration and voting. 
9. Voter has no geographical restricted from voting. 

WEAKNESS OF ONLINE VOTING:-
The  weakness  to the  integration and  total deployment of  online  technology in  voting  begins from awareness, policy and technology. Different countries of the world have different views of mobile technology when in relation with voting. The civilized and developed countries have what it takes to deploy mobile voting in their electoral systems technologically, while the developing and the underdeveloped countries have lots to put in place to fully deploy online technology in voting.

4W's and 1'H
Who: online voting system that facilitates user(voter), candidate and administrator (who will be in charge and will verify all the user and information) to participate in online voting. 

What: Benefits. Electronic voting technology intends to speed the counting of ballots, reduce the cost of paying staff to count votes manually and can provide improved accessibility for disabled voters. Also in the long term, expenses are expected to decrease. Results can be reported and published faster.

When: 16 October 2005

Where: voters in Estonia was the first country to introduce online voting system

How: Procedure for how to implement the project-
1.Vote for your favorite Candidate.
2.Check the number of votes of each Candidate.
3.Check the candidate who is leading and then Exit.
4.The user chooses one of the options.
a.If the user chooses 1, then the list of candidates is displayed and the user can now choose from this list of candidates.
b.If the user chooses 2, then the list of candidates along with their current number of votes is displayed.
c.If the user chooses 3, the name of the candidate with the maximum number of votes is displayed. d.If there is more than one candidate with maximum votes, display an error message stating “No winner”.
5.This program continues until the user chooses 0 to exit().
